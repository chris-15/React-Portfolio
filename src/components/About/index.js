        I am currently a Mechanical Engineer looking to change careers into the Software Engieering field. After graduating from the Universtiy Of Connecticut in 2016, I started working in the aerospace engineering industry. Within a few years I realized that I had a passion for computers and started building computers to use for gaming! Soon after that I started getting interested in coding and  realized I could make it into a career. At the start of 2022 I started my journey to transition careers by enrolling in the University of Connecticut's Coding Bootcamp. Since starting the bootcamp, I have learned various concepts which have grown my love for coding! Upon graduating from the bootcamp at the end of June 2022, I hope to land a job as full stack developer to showcase my skills!
